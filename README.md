# SPPARKS on Snellius HPC

## Introduction
This document provides a guide for setting up and running SPPARKS on the Snellius High Performance Computing (HPC) environment.

## About SPPARKS 
SPPARKS is a parallel Monte Carlo code for on-lattice and off-lattice models that includes algorithms for kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC), rejection kinetic Monte Carlo (rKMC), and Metropolis Monte Carlo (MMC).

It is developed by Sandia Labs, and it is used for modelling additive manufacturing processes via Potts model simulations which evolve microstructure in the presence of a moving laser spot which heats material.
